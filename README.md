# Dotfiles Repository - Initial Setup

## Overview

Welcome to my first attempt at creating a dotfiles repository! This repository is a humble beginning, serving as a personal journey to get accustomed to managing a `.dotfile` directory. As it stands, it includes basic configurations for `.oh-my-zsh`, `.vim`, and `.zshrc`. Consider it a living resource; by no means complete and open to continuous improvements and refinements.

## Current Contents

- `.oh-my-zsh`: Custom themes and plugins for the Oh My Zsh framework.
- `.vim`: Initial Vim configuration settings.
- `.zshrc`: Basic Zsh configuration with a few aliases and environment variables.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure `zsh`, `oh-my-zsh`, and `vim` are installed on your system.

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dotfiles.git
   cd dotfiles
   ```

2. **Manual Symlinking**:
   - Zsh configuration:
     ```bash
     ln -s $(pwd)/.zshrc ~/
     ```
   - Vim configuration:
     ```bash
     ln -s $(pwd)/.vimrc ~/
     ```
   - Oh My Zsh customizations:
     ```bash
     ln -s $(pwd)/.oh-my-zsh ~/
     ```

3. **Reload or Restart**:
   - For Zsh, use `source ~/.zshrc` or restart the terminal.
   - Vim settings will be applied on the next launch.

### Important Note:

This process currently requires manual symlinking. Be sure to backup your existing configurations to avoid accidental loss.

## Roadmap for Future Improvements

- **Automation**: Aiming to script the installation and symlinking process for ease of setup.
- **Enhancements**: Continuously adding more configurations and tweaks as I explore and learn.
- **Feedback and Contributions**: Open to suggestions, improvements, and contributions to make this resource more robust and useful.

## Contributions

Feel free to fork, modify, and use these configurations. Contributions to enhance or improve these dotfiles are always welcome. Follow the standard fork > feature branch > pull request workflow.

## Reminder

This repository reflects my personal preferences and workflow. It might not perfectly align with everyone's needs, so I encourage you to tweak and customize as you see fit.
